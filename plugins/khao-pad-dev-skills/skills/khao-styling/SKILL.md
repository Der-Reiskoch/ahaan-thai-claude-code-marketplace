# Khao Styling

- where possible we only use pure CSS without Pre- or Postprocessors
- for styling use **only** CSS custom properties from our Design System that you can find in the node module `@der-reiskoch/khao-malet`
- there are some additional CSS custom properties in the `khao-pad-hugo-theme`
- **DO NOT** invent any CSS yourself
- **DO NOT** propose any other CSS Libraries (Tailwind, Bootstrap etc.)
