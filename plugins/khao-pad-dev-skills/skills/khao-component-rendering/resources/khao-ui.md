# @der-reiskoch/khao-ui

## About

"Khao" (ข้าว) is the Thai name for rice. Just as rice is the basis of many Asian dishes, this component library will be the new basis for the blogs `Der Reiskoch`, `ahaan-thai.de` and other upcoming projects.

## Styling

The UI Components are styled with css-custom-properties that are provided by the "Khao Malet" design system. You can easily style them by overwriting the css-custom-properties.
