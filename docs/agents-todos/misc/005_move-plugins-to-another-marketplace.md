# Move Plugin to another marketplace

## Context

We have two plugins `plugins/todo-skills` and `plugins/skill-sharing` that do not fit in this specialized market place, so we want to move the to more general purpose marketplace

## Tasks

- We prepared an empty repo `~/Projects/foodie/ji-agent-skills`
- Make this a new repo a marketplace (see .claude-plugin as a template)
- The name should be `ji-agent-skills`
- Move both plugins/todo-skills`and`plugins/skill-sharing` to the new marketplace repo
- Register them in the new marketplace
- Remove any traces in the current repo
- Update all documentation files that reference `plugins/todo-skills` and `plugins/skill-sharing`
- Update the new marketplace`s README.md (use our README.md as a template)
