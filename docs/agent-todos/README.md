# Agent Todos

This folder contains task files for AI agents working on this project.

## Structure

- Each subdirectory represents a category of tasks
- Open task files use the naming convention: `NNNN_description.md`
- Completed task files use the naming convention: `DONE_NNNN_description.md`
- Completed tasks are prefixed with `DONE_`

## Status Lifecycle

Todo files include YAML frontmatter with a `status` field. Typical flow:

```mermaid
timeline
  title Todo Status Lifecycle
  new : Created but not yet fleshed out
  ready : Has content and can be picked up
  doing : Active work in progress
  done : Completed (also rename file with DONE_ prefix)
  archived : Reserved for future archiving
```
